**Link to project:** N/A

## How It's Made:

**Tech & libraries used:** HTML, CSS, SASS, React, Vite, React-Router.

I will be using simple libraries and if I need additional libraries I will update on the go. The purpose of this project is to refresh my memory using vanilla CSS because I've been relying too much on frameworks lately. I might add some additional features if I end up feeling like it.
